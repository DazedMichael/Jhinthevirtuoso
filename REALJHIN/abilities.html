                        <p>Instead of normal auto attacks, Jhin has a gun that carries four shots, the fourth shot deals extra damage and always critically strikes. after each cycle, the gun has to reload. After shooting the fourth shot, Jhin gains a burst of movement speed.

                        <p>Jhin fires a single magical shot with incredible range and dealing damage. If an enemy champion was damages by Jhin or an ally, it stuns. The shot pierces minions but can only stun one enemy champion.

                        <p>Jhin places a lotus trap, which then cloaks itself and is invisible. If an enemy champion stands on this trap, the area is given vision. After a short while, the flower blooms and deals damage in a small area. (this lotus trap also automatically spawns under an enemy champion after you kill them)

                        <p>Jhin mounts his gun on his shoulder and turns it into a mega cannon. Jhin starts channeling, he shoots 4 shots in a cone with huge range. When you hit an enemy with a shot, it briefly slows them. The shots slowly intensify, with the last shot doing significant damage and critically striking. The shots pass through minions but stop at the first enemy hit, although, if you have good aim and enemy champions stand close to each other, you can damage both of them.
